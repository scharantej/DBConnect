## Flask Application Design for Connecting to a Database

### HTML Files
- **index.html**:
  - The main page of the application that displays a form for users to input data.
  - Includes HTML elements such as input fields, labels, and a submit button.

### Routes
- **@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**:
  - The route for the main page (index.html).
  - Handles both GET and POST requests.
  - If a GET request is received, the page is rendered.
  - If a POST request is received, the data from the form is processed and connected to the database.

- **@app.route('/connect_db', methods=['POST'])**:
  - A route to connect to the database and perform database operations.
  - Only handles POST requests.
  - Extracts the user's data from the POST request and connects to the database.
  - Executes SQL commands based on the user's data (e.g., inserting data, fetching results).
  - Returns a response to the user after completing the database operations.
